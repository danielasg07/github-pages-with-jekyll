# Welcome to my new blog

I love programming, cats, sleep and food.
My favorite band is the Beatles, here is my favorte song of them:


# Free as a bird

Free as a bird
It's the next best thing to be
Free as a bird
Home, home and dry
Like a homing bird I'll fly
As a bird on wings
Whatever happened to
The life that we once knew?
Can we really live without each other?
Where did we lose the touch
That seemed to mean so much?
It always made me feel so
Free as a bird
Like the next best thing to be
Free as a bird
Home, (home) home and dry
Like a homing bird I'll fly
As a bird on wings
Whatever happened to
The life that we once knew?
Always made me feel so free
Free as a bird
Is the next best thing to be
Free as a bird
Free as a bird
Free as a bird
